# Computer Vision (DD2423) Lab. 2: Edge Detection and Hough Transform

Federico Favia & Martin De Pellegrini, November 2019, KTH, Stockholm

This project in Matlab developed within the course of Computer Vision at KTH follows a series of operations to find edges in images: difference operators, gradient magnitude, edge detectino and Hough transform are used. Comments on the theory and the performances of the experiments are made as well. See the report for more information.
Below an image example of the detected edges on a sample image:
